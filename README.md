# AnalyseFinancialRecords

This Python script will analyse the csv data sources by reading the file from Resources Folder.

It will then calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* The analysis will print text to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
